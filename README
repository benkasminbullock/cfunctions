This is a new version of cfunctions, which is greatly simplified from
the old version. Almost all the command-line options are gone and the
basic operation is now

    cfunctions file.c

which creates a file "file.h". Documentation and source code are
currently being updated.

WHY?

I still use cfunctions, but every time I used the old version I was running it as 

    cfunctions -inc file.c

and did not use any other functionality. Nobody else seems to be interested in this old program any more, and there is much maintenance work for me to do if I want to keep on using it. Thus, to simplify the maintenance work, I've stripped out all the old stuff.
