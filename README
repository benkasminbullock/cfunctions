WHAT IS CFUNCTIONS?

Cfunctions (pronounced "see-functions") is a C programming utility
which makes C header files (files ending in ".h") from C program files
(files ending in ".c"). It does this by extracting function
prototypes, global variables and tag tables from C files. 

For example, if you input 

int y;

int example (int a)
{
  printf ("%i\n");
  return a;
}

cfunctions will output

extern int y;
int example (int a );

a declaration and a function prototype for a header (".h") file.

Cfunctions is particularly useful for programmers working with ANSI C
because it saves the trouble of repeatedly updating header files with
function prototypes after modifying the C program files.
