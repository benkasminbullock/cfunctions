/* The following `#define' is not a mistake.  INLINE is defined to
   nothing for both GNU and non-GNU compilers.  When Cfunctions sees
   `INLINE' it copies the whole of the function into the header file,
   prefixed with `extern inline' and surrounded by an `#ifdef
   X_INLINE' wrapper.  In order to inline the function in GNU C, only
   `X_INLINE' needs to be defined. There is also a normal prototype
   for the case that X_INLINE is not defined.  The reason for copying
   the function with a prefix `extern inline' into the header file is
   explained in the GNU C manual and the Cfunctions manual. */
