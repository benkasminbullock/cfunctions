<p> 

Cfunctions (pronounced `see-functions') is a free program for
extracting function prototypes and global variables from C files.

</p>

<p>

Cfunctions takes C files and extracts the global information such as
function prototypes and external variable declarations from them.

This is useful for 

<ul>

<li> 

writing header files 

<li> 

making forward declarations.  

</ul>

The default behaviour is to run as a filter so that Cfunctions can be
used as a typical Unix tool.  However it also has the facility to make
complete header files if you want it to, with

<ul>

<li> 

a banner at the top

<li> 

a preprocessor wrapper

<li> 

copying of verbatim material such as typedefs, macros or struct
definitions

</ul>

automatically generated.

</p>

<p> 

Cfunctions also has extra facilities for 

<ul>

<li> 

making GNU C style `extern inline' functions by copying the inline
functions into the header file, with a normal prototype for the case
of non-GNU C compilers.

</li>

<li> 

many GNU C extensions. 

</li>

</ul>

The usefulness of Cfunctions is that it cuts down on the cost of
making header files and maintaining them compared to hand-editing.
</p>

<p>

One can also use it to make forward declarations for static functions,
etc. by using it as a pipe.  It can also make a tag table from the C
file.

</p>

<p>

Cfunctions's default behaviour is to run as a `pipe', reading from
standard input and writing to standard output.  It can also
read files from the command line.  

</p>

<p>

Cfunctions can be controlled by command-line switches and by
directives in the C files themselves.

</p>

<p>

Cfunctions's current version is 0.29.

</p>

Cfunctions is free software licenced under the
