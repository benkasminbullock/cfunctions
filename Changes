* Remove GNU autoconf tools from build process, use "make" to build.
* "c-extensions.h" is no longer produced.
* The default is to make a header file for a C file, so the -i option
  is on automatically. There is no option to turn this off or get
  stdout output any more.
* The default is to add line numbers, so the -n option is on
  automatically. there is no option to turn this off or get it without
  line numbers any more.
